backboneTutorial
================

This is a backbone.js tutorial
There will not be a lot of theoretical explanations; everything will be shown through examples.

just do this:

git clone git://github.com/roclas/backboneTutorial.git

(or download and decompress the zip if you're using windows)
and you will have all the examples running in your machine; as easy as that. 
You will be able to modify the code and learn by doing, rather than by only reading.



Feel free to contact me at carlos _at_ roclas.com and tell me if you think I missed something.
If you want to be part of this project and write some good examples for this tutorial, you will be VERY WELCOME.
Thank you.
